This repository contains the analysis scripts for the study "More Than Just Bad Lifestyles: A De novo Genetic Approach Identifies Links Between Coronary Artery Disease and its Comorbidities". 
In the current study, we integrated data on gene expression (eQTLs), SNPs, the spatial genome organisation, and protein-protein interaction to identify both cis and trans-acting tissue-specific regulations associated with coronary artery disease. We then constructed tissue-specific regulatory networks, revealing five gene-gene interactions and one gene cluster unique to the coronary artery tissue.
